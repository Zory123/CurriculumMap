Notice: Qt v6.1.1(not creator) and above will be required to compile the code. 
We havenâ€™t use any third-party library except for Qt library, so just compile it would be fine.

If you think the courses.csv (in get-information folder) is old, you could run get-information.py to get the newest one.

Enrolled flag is helpful for simplifing

Reversely search only show courses that need the queried course, so pre-requisite of them may not be shown completely on map(sometimes strange), for accurate imformation, right click and then search for that course.

## Legend:

1. for exclusion, if A excludes B, which means you can't take A after B, there will be a red cross near A on line between A and B
