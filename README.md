# COMP2012H-GroupProject

Notice: Qt edition 6.1.1 and above will be required to compile the code. 
We havenâ€™t use any third-party library except for Qt library, so just compile it would be fine.

If you think the courses.csv in get-information folder is old, you could run get-information.py to get the newest one. 

:relaxed: :sparkles:
